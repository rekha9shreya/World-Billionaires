# World-Billionaires
Since April 2023, there have been 2,640 known billionaires
recorded in the world. This information is helpful for both
governmental policymakers and researchers to understand
how the distribution of wealth among various billionaires
impact economic policies, taxation, and wealth distribution in a
country. Governmental policymakers and researchers seek to
balance the possible unfair benefits of wealth accumulation
with the need to address inequalities and ensure an inclusive
economic growth between citizens.

# Key Questions:
★ What demographics affect the wealth of a billionaire?

★ Where are billionaires most populated in the world?

★ Are there any geographical factors that impact the wealth of a billionaire?

★ How are billionaires distributed around the world?

★ What factors correlate to the most number of billionaires in a country?

# Data
The "Billionaire's Statistic Data Set(2023)" data set's creator and compiler is Nidula Elgiriyewithana, a Sri Lankan data scientist and Kaggle Progression System Grand Master. The data was collected on April 4, 2023, and published to Kaggle in September 2023. The information was produced from a variety of sources, including Forbes and other financial journals. No more information about the sources was supplied.

Contents: 35 columns and 2,640 rows. This data collection includes information on each of the 2,640 billionaires identified as of April 4, 2023. There are categories for each person's basic demographics as well as statistics on their net worth in millions of US dollars (so 1,000 = 1 billion), the industry in which they got their fortune, and whether or not they are self-made. The data set also contains statistics about the people's home countries, such as life expectancy, consumer price index, GDP, and educational enrollment rates.
